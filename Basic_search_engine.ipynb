    "**Problem Statement - Enhancing Search Engine Relevance for Video Subtitles**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Background:**\n",
    "In the fast-evolving landscape of digital content, effective search engines play a pivotal role in connecting users with relevant information. For Google, providing a seamless and accurate search experience is paramount. This project focuses on improving the search relevance for video subtitles, enhancing the accessibility of video content.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objective:**\n",
    "Develop an advanced search engine algorithm that efficiently retrieves videos based on user queries, with a specific emphasis on subtitle content. The primary goal is to leverage natural language processing and machine learning techniques to enhance the relevance and accuracy of search results.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Core Logic:**\n",
    "To compare a user query against a video subtitle document, the core logic involves three key steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. TF-IDF Vectorization for Subtitle Document:\n",
    "   - Find the TF-IDF vector for each subtitle document.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. TF-IDF Vectorization for Query:\n",
    "   - Compute the TF-IDF vector for the user's query.\n",
    "   - Treat the query as a new document without recomputing IDF values.\n",
    "   - Utilize the previously computed IDF values, avoiding unnecessary recomputation.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Cosine Similarity Calculation:\n",
    "   - Compute the cosine similarity between the TF-IDF vector of the document and the TF-IDF vector of the query.\n",
    "   - This similarity score determines the relevance of the document to the user's query.\n"
